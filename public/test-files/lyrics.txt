[Intro]
(Piano intro, light and hopeful)

[Verse 1]
So long, I've been searching for a soul like yours,
Through nights that felt like years,
I kept hoping, kept dreaming,
That our paths would cross, that our eyes would meet.

[Chorus]
I've been searching for you,
A love that feels so true,
You're the one I've waited for,
Now my heart's not searching anymore.

(Guitar solo, uplifting and melodic)

[Verse 2]
Every time I closed my eyes,
I saw this moment, you and I,
In a world where time stands still,
Our love would write a story that could fill a thousand hills.

[Chorus, with a full band build]
I've been searching for you,
A love that feels so true,
You're the one I've waited for,
Now my heart's not searching anymore.

[Bridge]
(Piano and strings, building anticipation)
Through the maze of life, I wandered,
Till your light, your light I found,
In your gaze, a promise,
That our journey now is bound.

(Guitar and drums, leading to a climactic moment)

[Chorus]
I've been searching for you,
A love that feels so true,
You're the one I've waited for,
Now my heart's not searching anymore.

(Extended vocal section, with emotional depth)
My heart's not searching anymore,
You're the one I've waited for.

[Outro, with piano and strings softly fading out, conveying a sense of fulfillment]
